# What is R?

> <font size="+2"> <p align="justify">The R environment is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.</p></font>

</br>

A brief history:

- R is a dialect of the S language. 

- R was written by **R**obert Gentleman and **R**oss Ihaka in 1992. 

- The R source code was first released in 1995.

- In 1998, the Comprehensive R Archive Network [CRAN](http://CRAN.R-project.org/) was established.

- The first official release, R version 1.0.0, dates to 2000-02-29. Currently R 3.6.0 (May, 2019).

- R is open source via the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License).


---

# Explore the R architecture

- R is like a car's engine

- RStudio is like a car's dashboard, an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

# How do I code in R?

Keep in mind:

- unlike other software like Excel, STATA, or SAS, R is an interpreted language

- no point and click in R!

- **you have to program in R**!

R **packages** extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, and can be downloaded for free from the internet.

# Install and load an R package

The `ggplot2` package is a very popular package for data visualisation.

--

Install the package

```{r install_ggplot, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
--
Load the installed package

```{r load_ggplot, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```
--
And give it a try

```{r try_ggplot, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
head(diamonds)
qplot(clarity, data = diamonds, fill = cut, geom = "bar") 
```
--
Packages are developed and maintained by R users worldwide, and shared with the R community through CRAN: now 14,307 packages online!

# Little arithmetics with R

---

# Your first R steps

Do little arithmetics with R:

- write R code in the console

- every line of code is interpreted and executed by R 

- you get a message whether or not your code was correct

- the output of your R code is then shown in the console

- use # sign to add comments, like Twitter!

--

Now run in the console

```{r little_arithm, comment = '', eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
10^2 + 36
```
You asked and R answered!

# Objects and data types in R

---

# Variables

A basic concept in (statistical) programming is a **variable**. 

- a variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R

- use this variable’s name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.

Assign value `4` to variable `a`
```{r work_with_variables }
a <- 4
```
and verify the variable stored
```{r comment = ''}
a
```
---

# R challenge

Verify the following instructions

```{r little_arithm_challenge, eval=FALSE}
a*5
(a+10)/2
a <- a+1
```

---

# Data types

R works with numerous **data types**: e.g.

- decimal values like 4.5 are called **numerics**

- natural numbers like 4 are called **integers**

- Boolean values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) are called **logical**

- `Date` or POSIXct for time based variables<sup>[1]</sup>; `Date` stores just a date and `POSIXct` stores a date and time 

- text (or string) values are called **characters**.

.footnote[
[1] Both objects are actually represented as the number of days (`Date`) or seconds (`POSIXct`) since January 1, 1970.
]


---

# R challenge

Run the following instructions and pay attention to the code:

```{r}
my_numeric <- 42.5

my_character <- "some text"

my_logical <- TRUE

my_date <- as.Date("05/29/2018", "%m/%d/%Y")
```

Verify the data type of a variable with the `class()` function: e.g.

```{r comment = ''}
class(my_numeric)
class(my_date)
```

---

# Everything is an object

><p align="justify"> The fundamental design principle underlying R is “everything is an object”. </p> 

<br>

Keep in mind:

- in R, an analysis is broken down into a series of steps

- intermediate results are stored in objects, with minimal output at each step (often none) 

- manipulate the objects to obtain the information required

- a variable in R can take on any available data type, or hold any R object.

---

# R challenge

Run
```{r eval=FALSE}
ls()
```
to list all objects stored in R's memory.

Use `rm()` to remove an object from R's memory, e.g.

```{r eval=FALSE}
rm(a)                                     # remove a single object
rm(my_character, my_logical)              # remove multiple objects
rm(list = c('my_date', 'my_numeric'))     # remove a list of objects
rm(list = ls())                           # remove all objects
```

# Basic data structures in R

---

# Vectors

A **vector** is a simple tool to store data:

- one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data

- you create a vector with the combine function `c()`

- operations are applied to each element of the vector automatically, there is no need to loop through the vector.

Here are some first examples:

```{r vectors_in_R, eval=FALSE}
my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
my_vector_2 <- c(0, 3:5, 20, 0)                      
my_vector_2[2]       # inspect entry 2 from vector my_vector_2
my_vector_2[2:3]     # inspect entries 2 and 3
length(my_vector_2)  # get vector length
my_family <- c("Katrien", "Jan", "Leen")
my_family
```

---

# R challenge

You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the `names()` function:

```{r vector_challenge, comment = ''}
my_vector <- c("Katrien Antonio", "teacher")
names(my_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")
my_vector
```

Now it's your turn!

Inspect `my_vector` using: 

- the `attributes()` function

- the `length()` function

- the `str()` function

---

# R challenge solved

```{r vector_challenge_solved, comment = ''}
my_vector <- c("Katrien Antonio", "teacher")
names(my_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")
my_vector

attributes(my_vector)
length(my_vector)
names(my_vector)
```

---

# Matrices

A **matrix** is:

- a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) 

- fixed number of rows and columns.

A first example

```{r matrices_in_R, comment = ''}
my_matrix <- matrix(1:12, 3, 4, byrow = TRUE)
my_matrix
my_matrix[1, 1]
```

---

# Data frames and tibbles

A **data frame**:

- is pretty much the *de facto* data structure for most tabular data 

- what we use for statistics

- variables of a data set as columns and the observations as rows.

--

A **tibble**:

- a.k.a `tbl` 

- a type of data frame common in the `tidyverse`

- slightly different default behaviour than data frames.

Let's explore some differences between both structures!

---

# R challenge

Inspect a built-in data frame

```{r comment = '', eval = FALSE}
mtcars
str(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

Extract a variable from a data frame and ask a `summary`

```{r comment = '', eval = FALSE}
summary(mtcars$cyl)   # use $ to extract variable from a data frame
```

Now inspect a tibble

```{r comment = '', eval = FALSE}
diamonds
str(diamonds)  # built-in in library ggplot2
head(diamonds)
```

Can you list some differences?

---

# Lists

A **list** allows you to 

- gather a variety of objects under one name in an ordered way

- these objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists

- a list is some kind super data type

- you can store practically any piece of information in it!

---

# Lists

A first example of a list:

```{r comment = ''}
my_list <- list(one = 1, two = c(1, 2), five = seq(1, 4, length=5),
          six = c("Katrien", "Jan"))
names(my_list)
str(my_list)
```

---

# R challenge

1. Create a vector `fav_music` with the names of your favourite artists.

2. Create a vector `num_records` with the number of records you have in your collection of each of those artists.

3. Create a vector `num_concerts` with the number of times you attended a concert of these artists.

4. Put everything together in a data frame, assign the name `my_music` to this data frame and change the labels of the information stored in the columns to `artist`, `records` and `concerts`.

5. Extract the variable `num_records` from the data frame `my_music`. 

6. Calculate the total number of records in your collection (for the defined set of artists).

7. Check the structure of the data frame, ask for a `summary`.

---

# R challenge solved

Here is my solution

```{r}
fav_music <- c("Prince", "REM", "Ryan Adams", "BLOF")
num_concerts <- c(0, 3, 1, 0)
num_records <- c(2, 7, 5, 1)
my_music <- data.frame(fav_music, num_concerts, num_records)
names(my_music) <- c("artist", "concerts", "records")
```

---

# R challenge solved

```{r}
summary(my_music)
my_music$records
sum(my_music$records)
```

# Importing data in R

Some useful instructions regarding path names:

- get your working directory

```{r comment = ''}
getwd()
```

- specify a path name, with forward slash or double back slash

```{r comment = ''}
path <- file.path("C:/Users/u0043788/Dropbox/R tutorial/Basic R")
```

- use a relative path

```{r eval=FALSE}
path <- file.path("./data/swimming_pools.csv")
```

---

# Import a .txt file

`read.table()` is the most basic importing function.

You can specify tons of different arguments in this function. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
path.hotdogs <- file.path(path, "hotdogs.txt")
path.hotdogs    # inspect path name
hotdogs <- read.table(path.hotdogs, header = FALSE, 
                      col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"))
str(hotdogs)    # inspect data imported
```

or like this

```{r eval=FALSE}
hotdogs2 <- read.table(path.hotdogs, header = FALSE, 
                       col.names = c("type", "calories", "sodium"),
                       colClasses = c("factor", "NULL", "numeric"))
str(hotdogs2)
```

What happened?

---

# Import a .csv file

`read.csv()` is the basic importing function.

Here is an example:

- load a data set on swimming pools in Brisbane 

- column names in the first row; a comma to separate values within rows

```{r eval=FALSE}
path.pools <- file.path(path, "swimming_pools.csv")
pools <- read.csv(path.pools)
str(pools)
```

But, what happens?

--

With `stringsAsFactors` you can tell R whether it should convert strings in the flat file to factors.

```{r eval=FALSE}
pools <- read.csv(path.pools, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(pools)
```

# Import a .xlsx file

The `readxl` package makes it easy to get Excel data into R:

- no external dependencies, so it’s easy to install and use 

- designed to work with tabular data.

```{r eval=FALSE} 
library(readxl) 
path.urbanpop <- file.path(path, "urbanpop.xlsx") 
excel_sheets(path.urbanpop) # list sheet names with `excel_sheets()`
```

Specify a worksheet by name or number, e.g.
```{r eval=FALSE} 
pop_1 <- read_excel(path.urbanpop, sheet = 1) 
pop_2 <- read_excel(path.urbanpop, sheet = 2) 
```

inspect and re-combine
```{r eval=FALSE} 
str(pop_1) 
pop_list <- list(pop_1, pop_2) 
```

---

# Import other data formats

The `haven` package enables R to read and write various data formats used by other statistical packages.

It supports:

- **SAS**: `read_sas()` reads .sas7bdat and .sas7bcat files and `read_xpt()` reads SAS transport files (version 5 and version 8).
`write_sas()` writes .sas7bdat files.

- **SPSS**: `read_sav()` reads .sav files and `read_por()` reads the older .por files. `write_sav()` writes .sav files.

- **Stata**: `read_dta()` reads .dta files (up to version 15). 
`write_dta()` writes .dta files (versions 8-15).

---

# R challenge

Load the following data sets, available in the course material:

- the Danish fire insurance losses, stored in `danish.txt`

- the severity data set, stored in `severity.sas7bdat`.

---

# R challenge solved

Import the Danish fire insurance losses

```{r}
path <- file.path('./data')
path.danish <- file.path(path, "danish.txt")
danish <- read.table(path.danish, header = TRUE)
danish$Date <- as.Date(danish$Date, "%m/%d/%Y")
str(danish)
```

Import the severity data set

```{r eval=FALSE}

# A numeric variable

You first explore a **numeric** variable:

load the `CPS1985` data set and inspect the `wage` variable

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
getwd()
CPS1985 <- read.table("./data/CPS1985.txt", header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
summary(CPS1985$wage)         # get a summary
is.numeric(CPS1985$wage)      # check if variable is numeric
mean(CPS1985$wage)            # get mean
var(CPS1985$wage)             # get variance
```

---

# A numeric variable

You first explore a **numeric** variable:

visualize the `wage` distribution

```{r out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
hist(log(CPS1985$wage), freq = FALSE, nclass = 20, col = "light blue")
lines(density(log(CPS1985$wage)), col = "red")
```

---

# A factor variable

You now explore the `occupation` variable

```{r comment = ''}
summary(CPS1985$occupation)
```

change the names of some of the levels

```{r comment = ''}
levels(CPS1985$occupation)[c(2, 6)] <- c("techn", "mgmt")
summary(CPS1985$occupation)
```

visualize the distribution

```{r eval=FALSE}
tab <- table(CPS1985$occupation)
prop.table(tab)
barplot(tab)
pie(tab, col = gray(seq(0.4, 1.0, length = 6)))
```

---

# Two factor variables

You now explore the factor variables `gender` and `occupation`.

Use `prop.table()`

```{r comment = ''}
attach(CPS1985)                 # attach the data set to avoid use of $ 
table(gender, occupation)       # no name_df$name_var necessary
prop.table(table(gender, occupation))
detach(CPS1985)                 # now detach when work is done
```

---

# Two factor variables

Now try `prop.table(table(gender, occupation), 2)`.

What happens?

---

# Two factor variables

You now explore the factor variables `gender` and `occupation`.

Do a mosaic plot

```{r out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
plot(gender ~ occupation, data = CPS1985)
```


---

# A factor and a numeric variable

You now explore the factor `gender` and the numeric variable `wage`.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
attach(CPS1985)
```

```{r}
tapply(wage, gender, mean)
tapply(log(wage), list(gender, occupation), mean)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
detach(CPS1985)
```

---

# A factor and a numeric variable

You now explore a factor variable and a numeric variable.

Visualize the distribution of `wage` per `gender`

```{r out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
boxplot(log(wage) ~ gender, data = CPS1985)
```
---

Now try with

```{r out.width='75%', fig.align="center"}
boxplot(log(wage) ~ gender + occupation, data = CPS1985)
```

# Basic plot instructions 

Your starting point is the construction of a **scatterplot**:

- load the `journals.txt` data set and save as `Journals` data frame

- work through the following instructions

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(log(subs), log(citeprice), data = Journals)
rug(log(Journals$subs))
rug(log(Journals$citeprice), side = 2)
```

and adjust the plotting instructions

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(log(citeprice) ~ log(subs), data = Journals, pch = 19, 
     col = "blue", xlim = c(0, 8), ylim = c(-7, 4), 
     main = "Library subscriptions")
rug(log(Journals$subs))
rug(log(Journals$citeprice), side=2)
```

---

# Basic plot instructions

The `curve()` function draws a curve corresponding to a function over the interval [from, to].


```{r out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
curve(dnorm, from = -5, to = 5, col = "red", lwd = 3, 
      main = "Density of the standard normal distribution")
```

---

# Plots with ggplot2

The aim of the `ggplot2` package is to create elegant data visualisations using the grammar of graphics. 

--

Here are the basic steps:

- begin a plot with the function `ggplot()` creating a coordinate system that you can add layers to

- the first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset to use in the graph

--

Thus

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg)
ggplot(mpg)
```

creates an empty graph.

---

# Plots with ggplot2

You complete your graph by adding one or more **layers** to `ggplot()`. 

--

For example: 

- `geom_point()` adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot

- `geom_smooth()` adds a smooth line

- `geom_bar` a bar plot.

--

Each geom function in `ggplot2` takes a mapping argument: 

- how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties

- always paired with `aes()` and the $x$ and $y$ arguments of `aes()` specify which variables to map to the $x$ and $y$ axes.

---

# Plots with ggplot2

```{r comment = '', tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align="center"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

---

# Plots with ggplot2

```{r comment = '', tidy=TRUE, message=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, 
               color = class))
```
---

# Plots with ggplot2

Compare the following set of instructions:

- inside of aesthetics

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

- inside of aesthetics, not mapped to a variable

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

- outside of aesthetics

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

---

# Plots with ggplot2 

Now play with different geoms:

- a scatterplot

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

- a boxplot

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

- a histogram

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = hwy))
```

- a density

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
geom_density(mapping = aes(x = hwy))
```

---

# Plots with ggplot2

Now you will add multiple geoms to the same plot.

Predict what the following code does:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```


---

# Plots with ggplot2

Mappings and data can be specified **global** (in `ggplot()`) or local.

```{r message=FALSE, out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + theme_bw()       # adjust theme 
```


---

# Plots with ggplot2

Mappings and data can be specified global or **local**.

```{r message=FALSE, out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth() + theme_bw()
```


---

# Plots with ggplot2

Mappings and data can be specified global or **local**.

```{r message=FALSE, out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
library(dplyr)
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, drv == "f")) + theme_bw()
```

---

# R challenge

Use the Danish fire insurance losses. Plot the arrival of losses over time. 

1. Use `type= "l"` for a line plot, label the $x$ and $y$-axis, and give the plot a title using main.

2. Do the same with instructions from ggplot2. Use `geom_line()` to create the line plot.

---

# R challenge solved

A classic plot of the Danish fire insurance losses

```{r out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
plot(danish$Date, danish$Loss.in.DKM, type = "l", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Loss",
     main = "Fire insurance data")
```

---

# R challenge solved

With `ggplot2`

```{r out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
ggplot(danish, aes(x = Date, y = Loss.in.DKM)) +  
	geom_line() + theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Fire insurance data", x = "Date", y = "Loss") 
```

---

# R challenge

1. Use the data set `car_price.csv` available in the documentation. Import the data in R.

2. Explore the data.

3. Make a scatterplot of price versus income, use basic plotting instructions and use `ggplot2`.

4. Add a smooth line to each of the plots (using `lines` to add a line to an existing plot and `lowess` to do scatterplot smoothing and using `geom_smooth` in the `ggplot2` grammar).

# R challenge solved

Load the data

```{r}
car_price <- read.csv("./data/car_price.csv")
```

Do a traditional plot

```{r comment = '', out.width='35%', fig.align="center"}
plot(price ~  income, data = car_price)
lines(lowess(car_price$income, car_price$price), col = "blue")
```

---

# R challenge solved


With `ggplot`

```{r comment = '', out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
ggplot(car_price, aes(x = income, y = price)) +
  geom_point(shape = 1, alpha = 1/2) + 
  geom_smooth() + theme_bw()
```

# Data wrangling in R

# Two directions for data wrangling

Two lines of work are available:

- the RStudio line offering the packages from the `tidyverse`, including the `dplyr` package

- the `data.table` line developed by Matt Dowle, see e.g. DataCamp’s course on `data.table`.

--

Both 

- offer advanced, and fast, data handling with large R objects and lots of flexibility 

- have a very specific syntax, with a demanding learning curve.

This tutorial will explore the first direction. 

---

# A tibble instead of a data.frame

Within the `tidyverse` `tibbles` are a modern take on data frames:

- keep the features that have stood the test of time

- drop the features that used to be convenient but are now frustrating. 

You can use: 

- `tibble()` to create a new tibble

- `as_tibble()` transforms an object (e.g. a data frame) into a tibble.

---

# R challenge

Transform `mtcars` into a tibble and inspect

```{r eval=FALSE}
str(mtcars)
```


```{r message=FALSE, out.width='45%', fig.align="center"}
library(tibble)
as_tibble(mtcars)
```


---

# Pipes in R

In R, the pipe operator is `%>%`. 

You can think of this operator as being similar to the `+` in a ggplot2 statement. 

It takes the output of one statement and makes it the input of the next statement. 

When describing it, you can think of it as a “THEN”.

--

A first example: 

- take the `diamonds` data (from the `ggplot2` package)

- then subset

```{r eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Ideal")
```

---

# Data manipulation verbs

The `dplyr` package holds many useful data manipulation verbs:

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables

- `select()` picks variables based on their names

- `filter()` picks cases based on their values

- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary

- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation “by group”.

---

# filter()

Extract rows that meet logical criteria.

--

Here you go:

- inspect the `diamonds` data set

- filter observations with `cut` equal to `Ideal`

```{r}
filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal")
```

---

# filter()

Here is an overview of logical tests

<center>
<img src="Images/basic/logical_tests.png" width="400"/>
</center>

---

# mutate()

Create new columns.

--

Here you go:

- inspect the `diamonds` data set

- create a new variable `price_per_carat`

```{r}
mutate(diamonds, price_per_carat = price/carat)
```

---

# Multistep operations

Use the `%>%` for multistep operations. 

Passes result on left into first argument of function on right.

Here you go:

```{r}
diamonds %>% mutate(price_per_carat = price/carat) %>% 
  filter(price_per_carat > 1500) 
```


---

# summarise()

Compute table of summaries.

Here you go: 

- inspect the `diamonds` data set

- calculate mean and standard deviation of `price`

```{r}
diamonds %>% summarise(mean = mean(price), std_dev = sd(price))
```

---

# group_by()

Groups cases by common values of one or more columns.

Here you go: 

- inspect the `diamonds` data set

- calculate mean and standard deviation of `price` by level of `cut`

```{r}
diamonds %>% group_by(cut) %>% summarize(price = mean(price), carat = mean(carat))
```

---

# R challenge

1. Load the data `Parade2005.txt`.

2. Determine the mean earnings in California.

3. Determine the number of individuals residing in Idaho.

4. Determine the mean and the median earnings of celebrities.

---

# R challenge solved

Here you go:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Parade2005 %>% filter(state == "CA") %>% 
              summarize(mean = mean(earnings))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
Parade2005 %>% filter(state == "ID") %>% summarize(number = n())
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
Parade2005 %>% group_by(celebrity) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(earnings), median = median(earnings))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
Parade2005 %>% group_by(celebrity) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = celebrity, y = earnings)) + theme_bw() +
  geom_boxplot(color = "blue")
```

# Writing functions in R

# Conditionals and control flow

You’ll first learn about relational operators to see how R objects compare.

Make sure not to mix up `==` and `=`, where the latter is used for assignment and the former checks equality.

```{r eval=FALSE}
3 == (2 + 1)
"intermediate" != "r"
(1 + 2) > 4
katrien <- c(19, 22, 4, 5, 7)
katrien > 5
```


---

# Logical operators

Now you'll learn about logical operators to combine logicals

```{r eval=FALSE}
TRUE & TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
5 <= 5 & 2 < 3
3 < 4 | 7 < 6
```

applied to vectors

```{r}
katrien <- c(19, 22, 4, 5, 7)
jan <- c(34, 55, 76, 25, 4)
katrien > 5 & jan <= 30
```

The `!` operator reverses the result of a logical value.

```{r}
!TRUE
```


---

# Conditionals 

Time to check the `if` statement in R.

```{r comment = ''}
num_attendees <- 30
if (num_attendees > 5) {
  print("You're popular!")
}
```

and the `if else`

```{r comment = ''}
num_attendees <- 5
if (num_attendees > 5) {
  print("You're popular!")
}else{
  print("You are not so popular!")
}
```

---

# Loops

You'll start with a `while` loop.

```{r comment = ''}
todo <- 64

while (todo > 30) {
  print("Work harder")
  todo <- todo - 7
}
```


---

# Loops in R

Now the `for` loop in R.

```{r comment = '', eval=FALSE}
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

# loop version 1
for (p in primes) {
  print(p)
}
# loop version 2
for (i in 1:length(primes)) {
  print(primes[i])
}
```


---

# Write your own function

Creating a function in R is basically the assignment of a function object to a variable. 

```{r comment = ''}
my_sqrt <- function(x) {
  sqrt(x)
}

# use the function
my_sqrt(12)
```

---

# Write your own function

You can define default argument values in your own R functions. 

Here you see an example:

```{r comment = ''}
my_sqrt <- function(x, print_info = TRUE) {
  y <- sqrt(x)
  if (print_info) {
    print(paste("sqrt", x, "equals", y))
  }
  return(y)
}

# some calls of the function
my_sqrt(16)
my_sqrt(16, FALSE)
my_sqrt(16, TRUE)
```

---

# Vectorized thinking

R works in a vectorized way. 

Check this by calling the function `my_sqrt` on an input vector.

---

# R challenge

1. Create a function that will return the sum of 2 integers

2. Create a function that given a vector and an integer will return how many times the integer appears inside the vector.

3. Create a function that given a vector will print by default the mean and the standard deviation, it will optionally also print the median. Use an instruction like this
```{r eval=FALSE}
cat("Mean is:", mean, ", SD is:", stdv, "\n")
```
for the print messages.

---

# R challenge solved

```{r comment = ''}
f.sum <- function (x, y) {
  r <- x + y
  r
}

f.sum(5, 10)
```

---

# R challenge solved

```{r comment = ''}
f.count <- function (v, x) {
  count <- 0
  for (i in 1:length(v)) {
    if (v[i] == x) {
      count <- count + 1
    }
  }
  count
}

f.count(c(1:9, rep(10, 100)), 10)
```

---

# R challenge solved

```{r comment = ''}
desi <- function(x, med = FALSE) {
  mean <- round(mean(x), 1)
  stdv <- round(sd(x), 1)
  cat("Mean is:", mean, ", SD is:", stdv, "\n")
  
  if(med){
    median <- median(x)
    cat("Median is:", median , "\n")
  }
}

desi(1:10, med=TRUE)
```
